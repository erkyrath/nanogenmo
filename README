National Novel Generation Month!
Created for https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo

"Spend the month of November writing code that generates a novel of 50k+ words."

I may wind up putting several independent generators in this repository. One at a time, though.

* paarfi: The Paarfi-o-matic

Or, "Redwreath and Goldstar Have Traveled to Deathsgate"

The generated text: http://eblong.com/zarf/essays/r-and-g.html

Paarfi of Roundwood is best known for being the author of several "Romances" of Dragaerean history. (_The Phoenix Guards_, etc.) He is nearly as well known for being prolix, generous of embellishment, and fictional.

As Paarfi was paid by the word -- or rather, he is a pastiche of such writers as Dumas, who were -- his dialogues frequently reach unseemly length in settling a single point or idea. I thought it amusing to generate a pastiche of the pastiche which takes this past the point of absurdity.

With apologies to Steven Brust and Alexandre Dumas, but none to Paarfi of Roundwood.
